You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return
 the display text as shown in the examples:

likes [] // must be "no one likes this"
likes ["Peter"] // must be "Peter likes this"
likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] // must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] // must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] // must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

63. Find The Parity Outlier

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

Examples
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)

P. Understand the Problem
  Explicit Requirements:
  - we have an array containing n amount of integers. Our goal is to find the single outlier based on the majority of the array contents

65. Reversing and Combining Text
(https://www.codewars.com/kata/56b861671d36bb0aa8000819/train/ruby)

Your task is to Reverse and Combine Words.

Input: String containing different "words" separated by spaces

1. More than one word? Reverse each word and combine first with second, third with fourth and so on...
  (odd number of words => last one stays alone, but has to be reversed too)
2. Start it again until there's only one word without spaces
3. Return your resultâ€¦

P. Understand the Problem
  Explicit Requirements:
  - we have to reverse and combine words. however they are not all done the same.
  - if there is more than one word. We first reverse each word
    - then we combine the first and the second. third with the fourth, etc

    set  reversed_array to the result of reversing each word in joined_str
    - iterate through an array which contains each reversed word and then pair each in groups of two (leaving a last alone if odd)
    -  add each pair to store_joined_words
    - iterate through store_joined_words and add the first index and last index of each pair together. If there is a final odd array then ignore that value

66. Integer reduction

In this Kata, you will be given two integers n and k and your task is to remove k-digits from n and return the lowest number possible, without changing the order of the digits in n. Return the result as a string.

Let's take an example of solve(123056,4). We need to remove 4 digits from 123056 and return the lowest possible number. The best digits to remove are (1,2,3,6) so that the remaining digits are '05'. Therefore, solve(123056,4) = '05'.

Note also that the order of the numbers in n does not change: solve(1284569,2) = '12456', because we have removed 8 and 9.

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!


P. Understand the Problem
  Explicit Requirements:
  - we have our two integers. int1 (n) and int2(k). Our goal is remove k digits from n and return the lowest possible number

A: Algorithm
- intialize all_combs to an empty array
 get theresult of each possible pairs of twos from the input array and append to all_combs
 - initialize correct_comb to the result of iterating through all_combs and selecting each arr that when added together is equal to the input integer
 - if correct_comb is empty
    - return nil
 - if correct_comb is the size of 1
  - return correct_comb
 - else
 - initialize correct_result = 0
  - initialize second_index_of_chosen_words to the result of iterating through correct_comb and choosing the last index for each iteration
  - intialize first_word to the result of iterating throigh the input arr and returning i if the char is equal to  index 0 of second_index. Return the last
    character in case there are any that share the same number
    - initialize second_word and repeat the same process except acess index 1 of second_index
    -  if first_word < second_word set correct_result to first_word else set  correct_result to second_word
    - iterate through the input arr once more and get each char and i
      - return char if  i == to correct_result
   - initialize this result to final_index and get remove from arr
   - iterate through correct_comb  and choose the array that includes final_index
